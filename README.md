## Usage
```

As an avid reader
I want to be able to search for and view books
So that I can save and possibly purchase them later.

```

## Description
In this activity, you'll create a new React-based Google Books Search app. This assignment required me to create React components, work with helper/util functions, and utilize React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. I also used Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later.
